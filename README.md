# Earth Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes critical datasets related to climate change, natural disasters, and resource consumption. It examines five key areas: CO2 emissions, world energy consumption, precipitation patterns, earthquake occurrences, and temperature trends. The analysis aims to provide insights into environmental trends and their implications for global sustainability.

## Contents
- **Code**: Python scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Datasets**: Datasets sourced from NASA Earth Data and Kaggle.
- **Report**: A detailed analysis report summarizing findings and insights.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered datasets from reputable sources, focusing on their relevance to environmental changes.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Conducted rigorous cleaning processes to handle missing values and ensure data integrity.
3. **Data Analysis**: Utilized Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for statistical analysis and visualization.
4. **Insights Extraction**: Analyzed trends and correlations to draw meaningful insights from the data.

## Key Findings
- Significant trends in CO2 emissions, highlighting major contributors.
- Variability in precipitation patterns across countries.
- Insights into seismic activity and its implications for disaster preparedness.
- Temperature trends indicating regional climate differences.
